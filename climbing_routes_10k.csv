48310329-d22f-4bda-b6f6-4d317240a40e,Paradigm Shift,Mike Dahlberg,"Paradigm Shift may be the ultimate Red Wing route.  There are certainly some harder climbs at the bluff, but none personify so well the nature of hard climbing at Red Wing; incredibly crimpy, super technical, and very temperature dependent.  The first 50 feet are incredibly sustained, with no real letup until you reach the jug at bolt six; from there to the top is relatively easy 5.10 climbing with ample opportunity to depump before sneaking through the band of choss on top to reach the anchors.  The bottom two thirds of the route consists of three very difficult boulder problems, each one harder than the last, linked by easier but extremely technical terrain.  The first powerful, crimpy boulder problem gets you to the second bolt and the bottom of the distinctive seam/crack that diagonals up the lower part of the wall.  The seam consists of super techy 5.11+ that may seem impossible until you find the right sequence of microscopic footholds to see you through.  At the end of the seam, the next boulder problem tackles a powerful gaston and match on a slopey rail to reach the large pocket which is much worse than it looks.  Make the difficult clip from the pocket, then move left to reach the ""rest"" at a four inch long, incut crimper.  I would not consider this a rest on any other route, but you take what you can get and this is far and away the best hold between the ground and the jug at 50 feet.  Shake out as best you can before tackling another ten feet of awkward, technical 5.11 climbing to reach the ultimate crux of the route and the hardest individual moves, right after the fifth bolt.  There are numerous sequences for the last boulder problem, but they invariably all use the same razor sharp 1/4 inch crimper, tiny iron oxide gaston high and right, and some combination of worthless ripples and pockets as intermediates to reach the flat, positive crimper that finishes this V5 sequence.  Bearing down on the sharp holds enough to stick the last moves as your forearms reach meltdown is, needless to say, a good test of pain tolerance and tenacity.  Two more big reaches will bring you to that ""thank god"" jug out right and the end of the difficulties.  Due to the thin, crimpy nature of this route, it's highly temperature dependent and nearly impossible during the humid summer months.  There has been some debate as to the grade of this route, given 12d in Farris's guidebook.  Everyone I talked to who has done this route or come close, with the exception of one, felt strongly that it warrants the bump to 13a.  In comparison to other hard Red Wing routes such as Living All Over Me and Mississippi Burning that are considered solid for their grades, Paradigm was a huge leap in difficulty and seems deserving of the bump.  It would be great to see more traffic on this route and a few more opinions about the grade.  Whatever the rating, the route is a classic and deserves to see more attention.",,bolts,5.13a,Winter Wall,35,105826220,105813066,-92.52106,44.56899

And probably women too. Two recent sends (the most notable being Tyler Hoffart's second ascent 16 years after the first), however, have proved this thing not only goes, but is a great big ball of fun to climb as well. The line begins on an easy, left trending ramp to the far left side of the winter wall (think near NSP, Relentless, etc.). Basically, its the closest climbable line to the gully separating the winter wall and cyclops areas. You'll figure it out. After climbing the 5.5 ramp, take a break on the pedestal on top, then traverse right on two huecos into a sequence that seriously deserves a V-grade. Complete about 10 feet of hard, cool climbing which becomes rapidly more difficult as you move through it, until two stopper moves and an airy reach to a ledgy jug ends any difficulties. After a loud and energetic celebration (I think I screamed ""Yes!"" like 10 times), move up and right through slightly chossy 5.9 terrain to old anchors (shared with ""Longing for Miss Adonis"").

c50e2b56-0800-4fa0-a20c-504c572bfe52,Mississippi,Kieth Anderson,"Mississippi (former ""Mississippi Burning"") is the classic Red Wing hard route. Very technical, crimpy, and pumpy; it climbs like a series of difficult boulder problems with hard moves coming all the way to a potentially bitter end. Like many of the harder routes at the bluff this one seems much harder until you figure out all the little tricks. Down low a long lockoff to a fingerlock sets you up for the first crux; either a big reach out left to bump off a very poor gaston or a wild three foot deadpoint all the way to the great incut edge up high. A few more tricky moves brings you to an excellent rest just left of Barnburner. The next fifteen feet of intense climbing takes you through a big stab out left for a pocket, powerful laybacking, and finally the crux of the climb: a traverse left to a decent rail. For those fortunate few over about 6'3"" or with a ridiculous ape-index, the rail can be reached all the way from the decent holds out right. Everyone else must bump using a slopey sidepull/pinch, a perpetually slimy crimp, and some worthless footholds with the difficulty inversely proportional to your height. The sustained nature of this section makes it very tiring to link because of the difficulty of clipping the bolts. A better option is to clip high and downclimb back to the good rest, then climb all the way from the jug to the rail without stopping, then clip the bolt at your knees. This way saves precious energy but requires a little more psyche as you contemplate the whipper while crimping the life out of that slimy edge! Once through the crux, it's not over yet. Another difficult boulder problem from the rail finally gets you to a hold worth writing home about. Ten more feet of moderate climbing leads to the anchors and, for most, the exhilarating experience of clipping the chains pumped out of your mind. Phew!",,Bolts; the bolts are unfortunately a bit too far left at the bottom making the clips a little awkward.,5.12c,Winter Wall,38,105826224,105813066,-92.52106,44.56899

Short, but powerful and sustained, with excellent moves on good rock; Living All Over Me is a change from the delicate, crimpy climbing that is so common on other hard routes at the bluff.  Flat edges lead from the ground to the first and overall crux of the climb; a powerful boulder problem pressing into a nasty gaston, getting into a tiny undercling, and then lunging for a great incut edge.  Shortly after, a rest is reached that allows you to shake out and chalk before committing to the second boulder crux; a powerful reach into a good undercling followed by a huge low percentage bump up and right to a good edge.  A few more moves up the arete and it's in the bag.  The true crux of the route lies in sticking the dicey lunge near the top despite the fatigue of sending the more powerful lower section.  Extremely solid at the grade by the bluff's standards, Living All Over Me is a true Red Wing classic.",,bolts,5.12b,Winter Wall,40,105826230,105813066,-92.52106,44.56899

9879f8ae-f9ec-4ee6-9c53-63533c64e3a8,Kelly's Arete,Kelly Gorder,"Easily overlooked because of its longer, more popular neighbors to the right on the winter wall; Kelly's Arete offers superb, delicate climbing up the arete just to the left of Jam and Jelly.  Start up the crack until you can reach left and clip the first bolt.  At this point it is possible to move out onto the arete proper and begin the real climbing.  A good sidepull allows a long reach to clip the second bolt before beginning the crux, one of the best sequences you'll encounter at the bluff.  Reaching from a small left hand undercling, the right is bumped up the arete until a decent pinch is found.  Smearing the right foot against a ripple in the rock, the left is brought up to a good edge parallel with the undercling.  This position seems tailor made to generate an uncontrollable barndoor swing when the left hand is released, but with a deep dropknee you can release your hand just long enough to make an enormous reach to a slopey pocket up high.  A few desperate bumps and you can reach a decent hold around the arete to the right, leading to easier but still technical moves to reach the chains.  Unfortunately, clipping the third bolt is very difficult and comes right in the middle of the crux sequence, necessitating a horrible heelhook.  Some have chosen to skip the third bolt and climb through the crux before clipping.  This should be done with caution though, as a large fall is risked on a very short climb, and a grounder could occur.  Perhaps clipping the second bolt with a locking biner instead of a draw would help slightly, and obviously an attentive belayer is a must!  However you choose to do it, Kelly's Arete offers some of the bluff's most aesthetic climbing and should be high on everyone's ticklist.",,"Bolts--Can also be easily TR'ed by leading Jam and Jelly, which ends on the same ledge.

Twenty feet of crimpy climbing brings you to the cruxes.  The first is a delicate, improbable cross through off a flat undercling sloper.  The sloper can't really be grasped, just pushed up on by standing up, and crossing through seems ridiculous until you finally commit and go for it.  Many people, particularly those of a shorter stature, end up lunging at the end of the cross through; luckily the pockets you're reaching for are two of the most improbably perfect jugs you'll ever encounter on a route.  Shake out and clip from the jugs, then go for the next crux; a huge deadpoint dyno to a flat edge three or four feet above the holes.  This hold must be hit perfectly to prevent you're feet from popping off the nonexistent smears for feet.  Once through the second crux, easier climbing featuring a fist jam rest, the world's best two finger pocket, and a couple of perfect oxide crimps lead to one last long move to a jug at the anchors.",,bolts,5.11d,Winter Wall,31,105826213,105813066,-92.52106,44.56899

There are possibilities for high gear placements to protect the traverse. The left variation starts below the ledge and goes straight up. Only one piece of gear protects the move onto the ledge. Follow the crack up left to a good rest. The crux gear is in solid rock and it is possible to get in 2 to 3 pieces to protect it. Keep hauling up the crack until you're under a large flake.

Make a committing, but not too difficult move up and out of the dihedral to the bolt.  Shake out the legs and arms then run up the fun face past several bolts to the groove where you'll make about a 30 foot runout for the anchors while pondering the route's name and gunning for glory (don't slip up!).  There's three bolts for the anchor and, at the time of this posting, only one is any good.  One of the bad ones is a new anchor but, unfortunatley, was poorly placed and is loose (i.e., the bolt rattles around in the hole and the hanger nut needs to be tightened down).  The other bad bolt (the reason for the two new bolts) is an old button head and a mighty thin hanger.  Bring a bolt kit and one new bolt/hanger set up to fix a safer anchor if you can.

The corner looks pretty blank and intimating but i've found there is a wonderful side pull towards the center of the dihedral it has a plant growing out of a crack. Pull onto the ledge on the opposite side of the dihedral and begin climbing up the face. About half way up the face you will find a giant flake which provides a great under cling.

The name comes from the seam feature on the boulder. There was originally a old jagged stump that one would have to cover with pads and it made it less than ideal to fall. Around 2011 the Stump was removed and for about a year it lay next to this climb as climbers who couldn't get established would grab the stump and place it back in the whole as a cheater start. I'm guessing the stump has now been completely dissolved. Work a series of side pulls and underclings. Smearing is key with the feet. This problem is one of the few in Palisades that actually gets good friction with the feet.,,,V4,Bridge Boulder,999999,106766286,114552259,-96.5181,43.68872

After three bolts of the technical stuff, you reach a series of large ledges that are big enough to hang out on.  Hike up to a chain link, which was graciously put there to help climbers avoid rope drag, so use it instead of the bolt.  Then begin climbing up and over a roof and onto the face.

Basically, go down the same trail that leads to the back side of Outer Outlet and the Conn Diagonal climb but then turn to the left and continue downhill on a well worn trail that leads to a tall dome shaped spire. The climb is just left of the two small white birch trees. The first bolt is about 20 feet off of the deck, but it can be easily approached from the adjacent ugly gully. I highly recommend the direct ascent. The route is also fairly run outt near the top, but there is a horizontal crack that takes a #1 tricam or small cam. After the last bolt, follow the unprotected arete or slide around to the right and go up last protected part of Aging Gracefully to the intermediate bolt/chain anchor. If you choose the second option, you need to place a double sling on the last bolt of Creeping Senility and a single sling on the last button bolt for Aging Gracefully to avoid monster rope drag. The approximately 175 foot high summit can be reached with a 60 M rope with about 3 M to spare, otherwise with a shorter rope you can make it a two pitch climb. It's an easy unprotected scramble from the intermediate belay up to a large ledge and on up to the true summit, where a new bolt anchor has been provided. Two ropes are needed for rap from either anchor.",,Seven or eight bolts with runout in the middle and near the top of the climb. A #1 tricam and/or small flexible cam can be used if desired in a horizontal crack.,5.6,Old People's Dome,0,105715454,105714621,-103.56899,43.8491

Getting to the first bolt is probably the crux. Another trouble spot is having to stretch to the right to reach a foothold below the 5th bolt. I found that clipping this bolt pulls your second to the right off of the more comfortable holds to the left. Apparently there is a horn that can be slung above this point so it may be better to skip the 5th bolt?

Brent Kertzman and Paul Muehl climbed it in 1982 and found evidence of a yet earlier ascent. Cheyenne Caffey and Mark Orsag placed the anchors, cleaned the route, and added a bolt in 2013. This route is an oddly un-Needles-like trad jugbash. The route starts on a right-trending slab/ramp. At the top of the slab/ramp, it continues to the right in an ascending traverse through a series of large, wildly-shaped wind-eroded holds. It circles below and around an obvious pillar half to two-thirds of the way up. It then climbs up and behind (to the right) of the pillar. Step back left onto the top of the pillar. Clip a single bolt that protects a face move on a bulging slab, and jog up and left to the two-bolt anchor and a generous belay ledge. Sylvan Lake is visible from the top. Good beginner trad lead, though it is a touch physical for an easy climb.","From the Sylvan Lake parking lot, follow the trail around the lake and to the left. Go through the tunnel and bear left toward the bridge/boardwalk on Sunday Gulch Trail. Stop at the beginning of the bridge and head up into the gulley directly right/north of you. A 3rd class scramble gets you into the gully. The ramp and a number of good belay stances should be obvious. Probably best belayed by the leader from above. Rap with 60m rope gets you down easily.","Good cam placements and opportunities to sling the large features almost all the way through. The only marginal placement is atop the pillar, and the single bolt helps there. G-rated climb. Bring at least two slings or runners. Otherwise, a standard rack should suffice.

Start out with a scramble of about 15' off the flat boulder to a nice ledge. This ledge is a good place to belay and set up a basecamp for climbing the next four routes listed here. The route climbs the bolted water groove above the ledge. The crux is near the overlap in the middle of the pitch. This route makes for a nice warmup.,As you walk into the Big Gash about 50' in there is a flat boulder you must step down over. At this point on the right side are the first two routes. Look up the left side and there is a water groove about 45' above you.

Face the obvious route Brad's Boner that divides Sentinel Rock from Lost Arrow Spire. NBF is accessed by scrambling up a slick gulley well to the right of Brad's Boner and working your way around a small vertical, dripping moss band. Reach a platform by passing the miniature 5.12 TR /trad route Venom on the left. There is another set of anchors across the gulley to your right on a 35 ft. pyramid of black schist ( unknown 5.6 trad). Nothing but Fun is 5 ft. right (past) Venom on the left. The start is confusing as there are several variations. The bolted rib is probably the easiest start to spot, but this probably raises the grade into the 8+/9- range. A friction face and a chimney start keep the grade at a mellow 5.8 but cause you to skip a bolt or two off the ground (still not too scary). A bullet hard steep crimpy face with cool holds blends into the NBF bolt line from the uphill side of the formation but is harder (10-). This variant is high quality but shortens the climb and can't be easily accessed from the approach gulley. To confuse things even more, some bolts have been added it appears to the Original (Sentinel Rock) Route [originally 5.8PG 13) on the downhill side of the Sentinel formation, and this line too merges with the NBF arête bolt line from the left!",Bolts- 7-10 depending on the variation.

IMO trying to complete this climb as written in the book is difficult to understand.  Start on P1 of Political Prowess following a right to left hand crack. Rig the second piece of pro on a quickdraw as a runner can fall into the crack and cause nasty drag.  Gain the top of the flake then continue straight up a smaller crack/seam protecting with smaller gear. This will top out at the belay for P2 of Political Prowess.  DO NOT belay here...instead traverse 30ft left to a gully where you'll find a verticle crack on the left where you can build a hanging belay to eyeball the entire second pitch.  Climb the wall following a series of criss crossing crack/seams exactly half a 60 meter rope length to a slender pyramid horn.  Here you must decide to belay again or bail(recommended) After this point rock quality degrades from excellent/very good to crap. (lichen and auto sized flakes destined for the talus heap) If you do continue straight up 5.9 you'll gain a 1.5ft ledge to belay for the last pitch.

After fighting through the overhang, step right ten feet and follow a perfect hand crack which leads to a overhanging roof. One might choose to set up an intermediate belay (3.5 camalot would be helpful)before the hand crack to avoid rope drag but is not necessary. The roof after the handcrack is not to strenuous, stepping left when possible keeps the route from becoming overwhelming. Build an anchor on a good ledge with chockstones or creative gear placements. Beware of slinging the massive detached rock found at the end of the pitch! For the second pitch, there is one bolt that protects the north-eastern arete.

Throw to the point on the lip and there is a spot for a right heel to be thrown up as a heel hook to finish off the mantle. The Sit to this would be very hard!

You'll have to chimney up a wide corridor for about 25 ft to find the start of the route (see ""close up"" pic). The first pitch consists of flaring cracks and ends in a large chimney. 60ft. The second pitch is maze-like. From the chimney, down climb a few feet and take a sharp turn right. Here you'll enter a giant hallway that you walk/scramble through for roughly 80ft. The finally pitch will now be to your right. It's a tight ramp that uses crack and chimney features to get you settled between the two summits. The summit on you're right is the false summit but it is worth checking out. You can either jump from the false summit to the true summit (if you're crazy) or, from the perch between the two summits, you can jam up a short crack and then make an awkward, backwards, stemming move to get you in place to mantle onto the true summit. This is the move and it's spicy when you think you'll have to reverse it to get down! Now enjoy the views fit for a King!","See the attached google map screen shots to help you find this gem. It's kind of a bushwhack and it took me two outings to find the proper route. Basically follow Horsethief Trail #14 until the intersection of Centennial Trail 89, stay right at this fork and continue on HL #14. You'll come to another intersection where a trail splits off to the right, stay left, on #14, and just keep going. Then use the climb Hopscotch as a landmark. It is a 60ft crack that splits a green face, it's on your left and is easy to spot. From here you'll go about another 50yds on trail #14. Then you'll head off into the woods on your right. You want to be on an old two track road, but it is not easy to tell if you're on it or not. There is an old box spring lying on a tree that will let you know if you're heading in the right direction. This is where the google map images will come in handy. You'll be gaining some elevation at this point; keep an eye out for Beeker and Jinni. These climbs have large boulders perched on there summits. Once you find the mass that is Sultan's Tower you'll hug the formation, heading up and going around it staying on the S, SW side. Look at the 3rd pic I posted. You'll come to a large corridor with a small grassy knoll and a dead tree stump.

Snag a rest and get set up for a leaping traverse to the right on crazy crimps and freaky feet. Gain another slab to the anchors.

About 25 yards North of the house boulder with a slightly angled landing, you can't miss it. More technical than powerful so it is hard to rate, but the crimps are pretty small. Start in the middle of the wall pretty much right under the overhanging tree. Find a small two finger crimp/pocket and start with right hand in or around there, and left hand on a crimp about a foot or so to the left. Stand up. Get foot/feet higher and reach for sharp crimps up and to the right. Reposition feet, stand up and reach for a good crimp up and to the right, or a crimpy v thingamabob just to the left of that (be careful because that v thing wants to be broken). Reposition feet and go for the top. Be careful because some of the top out holds are thin and might break easily. This problem is great because from the start, you slowly work your way right and towards the jugs on the arete, but you don't end up using them until the top out when they make for good feet.
